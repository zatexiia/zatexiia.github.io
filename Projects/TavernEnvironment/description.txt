Tavern Environment UE4
---
This tavern project is my personal project built in Unreal. I created all the assets by myself using Maya, Substance and Zbrush. I used some decals from Quixel.
This project's objectives was to create an entire environment using the knowledge I learned from this past year.
Thank you to J-Line who accepted to use his amazing concept.
